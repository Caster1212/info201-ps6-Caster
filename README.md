This website is about global temperature analysis. This app uses satellite temperature data from UAH. Temperature temp is measured as deviation (deg C) from 1991-2020 baseline. For the opening page, it contians some samples from the dataset. For the plot page, users can analyze the global temperature for different regions. Select the regions you are interested in. You see a monthly scatterplot and the corresponding trend lines. In this panel, I created two widgets, the first is check box which can be used to show trends. The second one is used to select the regions to display. For the third panel (tables), This panel displays average temperature over different time periods: months , years and decades. In this panel, I created a radio button widget for users to choose different time periods.
